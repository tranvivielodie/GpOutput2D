\title{Multiple two dimensional wavelet transform}
\usage{
Wavelet2D(x, wf, J = 1, boundary = "periodic")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix (for one map) or a three dimensional array (for several maps).
Two first dimensions correspond to maps dimensions.
The third one is the number of maps.}

\item{wf}{name of the wavelet filter to use in the decomposition.}

\item{J}{depth of the decomposition, must be a number less than or equal to log(min{M,N},2), with  M and N are respectively the number of rows and columns of each map.}

\item{boundary}{a character string which specified the method used for side effect. Only "periodic" is currently implemented.}
}
\value{
an object of class "Wavelet2D", which corresponds to
         a matrix (for one map) or an array (for several maps)
         of same dimension as \code{x}, with the wavelet coefficients.
}
\description{
performs two dimensional wavelet transforms on all images/maps of a data set.
}
\examples{
# inputs of the Campbell2D function
x1<-rep(-1,8); x2<-rep(5,8); x3<-c(5,3,1,-1,5,3,1,-1)
X <- rbind(x1,x2,x3)

# spatial domain of the Campbell2D output
nz<-64
z<-seq(-90,90,length=nz)

# Campbell2D function
Y = Campbell2D(X,z,z)

# Wavelet transform
w <-Wavelet2D(Y,wf="d4",J=2)

# Inverse wavelet transform
hatY <- Inverse2D(w)
