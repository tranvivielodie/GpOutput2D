\usage{
\method{plot}{Fpca2d}(
  x,
  type = c("inertia", "energy", "MeanPoe"),
  PC = 1:2,
  p = seq(0.5, 1, by = 0.05),
  z1 = NULL,
  z2 = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class "Fpca2d".}

\item{type}{a character vector, which the characteristics of \code{x}
are plotted. The default is c("inertia","energy","MeanPoe","SelectedCoeff").
It means that the \code{barplot} of proportion of inertia of each principal
component (\code{type}="inertia"), the one of the number of coefficients
estimated with PCA according to the total mean proportion of energy (\code{type}="energy"),
the image of the coefficients mean proportion of energy (\code{type}="MeanPoe"),
and the image which indicates which coefficients are estimated
by PCA or by empirical mean (\code{type}="SelectedCoeff"). These graphics can be separetely plotted.
The eigenfunctions can be plotted be specifying (\code{type}="eigenfunctions").}

\item{PC}{a vector with the numbers of which principal components are plotted. The default is c(1,2).}

\item{p}{a vector with the proportion of energy which are plotted. The default is seq(0.5,1,by=0.05).}

\item{z1, z2}{spatial coordinates.}

\item{...}{plot parameters (see \code{\link{plot}}, \code{\link{image}} or \code{\link{image.plot}}).}

\description{
